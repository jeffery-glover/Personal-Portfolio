                <p>I graduated from Penn State in 2011 with a degree in music. I was proud to have achieved so much in my four years there and, like everyone else, should have been excited to venture out into the world and put my newly obtained degree to good use. However, that was not the case. I had fallen out of love with music during my last few semesters. During those months I was teaching and performing outside of school and it really helped me realize that I was not a traditional musician. Maybe I had one too many unpleasant students or maybe too many people decided to forget to pay me for a gig… whatever it was I had decided that I needed a new direction.</p>

                <p>Fortunately, I spent my senior year planning for life after music by taking business and entrepreneurship classes as well as a few other classes not associated with the School of Music to try and broaden my background. I even discovered a love of the sport squash. When it came time to leave school I didn’t feel ready for the real world.</p>

                <p>Reluctantly, I spent the next year playing gigs and teaching at schools around my hometown of Fort Collins, CO. It was a year of soul searching and ambiguity, but slowly I began to understand what I wanted and needed to do. I needed to build.</p>

                <p>I was always surprised that musicians didn’t know how their instruments were built or what subtleties changed the way they sounded (even though they all had extraordinarily strong opinions on the subject) so I decided to do some digging. One thing led to another and I found myself in my grandfather’s woodshop with an eight-foot piece of 1/38th inch thick veneer. I spent weeks researching and trying out ideas until I finally had an end product. Building my own snare drum not only gave me tremendous satisfaction but also gave me a great understanding of what really makes a drum sound the way a drum does.</p>

                <p>After a few more projects (building drums, attic floors, mint gardens, etc…) I moved to California for the perfect woman who I met freshmen year of college. It wasn’t until a few months after the move that I decided to try my hand at coding- at first it was frustrating and I wasn’t sure I was going to enjoy it, but I kept at it.</p>

                <p>I noticed that the feeling of solving and issue in the code or completing the project was identical to the feeling of building a snare drum or a mint garden. It was satisfying and rewarding.</p>

                <p>There are moments these days when I’m stuck and I get really down about my journey to become a Front End Developer but I’ve learned that I have to keep going and get through the hurdles because the end goal is so rewarding that it makes the journey worth it. It has not been a conventional journey to get to where I’m at today but I’m glad I made it. I got my chance to experience a great passion of mine in music and now I’m getting the chance to fall back in love with it as a hobby. I know that I have a long way to go and that the learning never stops but I’ve got a strong spirit and am excited to see the road ahead. </p>

                <p>This, being one of my first Front End projects, was a simple project where we were given a mockup card and asked to replicate it with our own choice of animal. It was valuable as it gave some insight into the day to day of a Front End Developer. The project only involved simple HTML and CSS.

                <p>This project takes us through the day to day practices of a Front End Developer. Originally given a PDF-file as a design mockup the goal was to replicate the design in HTML and CSS. This project focused on developing a fully responsive website that displays images, descriptions and links to each of the projects. Once specifications were met, style and color were personalized.

                    <p>For this project, I was tasked with creating multiple objects with JavaScript and assigning them to the correct spot in the HTML. This involved creating functions, building loops and manipulating the data. The end result was a functioning resume which could easily be updated with little effort.

                    <p>The game engine and visual assets were provided from the start but nothing functioned. Using JavaScript players needed to be added, given movement, and given actions depending upon different events. Enemies were give channels to run in at random and at random speeds. Once all was said and done the final project was a simple recreation of the classic arcade game Frogger.

                    <p>This project was about removing jank from a website. There were many forced synchronous layout issues as well as optimization issues in the HTML. I reworked the JavaScript in a more responsive manner and also took the HTML and reworked it so that the render tree was as efficient as possible.</p>
